### Problem 2: Generate Odd Numbers up to a Terms

#### Logic :
- Loop i from 0 to a - 1

- Print: 2 * i + 1 (this formula gives the first `a` odd numbers)

### Problem 3: Odd Number Series Based on Even/Odd a
  #### Logic :
- If a is even, decrement it by 1.
- Then follow same logic as Problem 2: print first a odd numbers.

### Problem 4: Count Multiples in a List
#### Logic :
 - For each number i from 1 to 9:

    Count how many numbers in the list are divisible by i using modulo operation (num % i == 0)

- Store and display the count using an array.
